        Sanusi is a prominent traditional and religious figure in West Africa. As the Khalifa of the Tijaniyyah Sufi order of Nigeria and the neighbouring countries, he arguably has a politico-spiritual authority over the second largest Sufi order, with over 50 million adherents.[4] He grew up in the royal palace of his grand-uncle, and as a youth received both religious and secular education. Prior to his accession, Sanusi was an Islamic intellectual, academic, political economist and banker. He served as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2014, ushering in banking reforms until his suspension after he brought to light the $20 billion oil scandal.

            Sanusi was born on 31 July 1961 in Kano to a ruling class Fulani family of the Sullubawa clan. He grew up in the palace of his great-uncle Ado Bayero, who reigned for over five decades. His father, Aminu Sanusi, was a prince and diplomat who served as the ambassador to Belgium, China and Canada, and later permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was also the Chiroma of Kano and son of Muhammadu Sanusi I, who was the 11th Fulani Emir of Kano from 1953 to 1963, when he was deposed by his cousin Sir Ahmadu Bello.

     Sanusi received early religious education at home, where he learnt Qur'an and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad. He then attended St. Annes Primary School, a Catholic boarding school in Kaduna, before proceeding to King's College, Lagos from 1973 to 1977.[11] He received a bachelor's degree in Economics from the Ahmadu Bello University in 1981. After graduating, he spent a year undergoing his National Youth Service as a teacher in a girls boarding school in Yola. He then returned to the university where he received a master's degree in Economics in 1983, and lectured at the faculty for two years.

Sanusi later moved to Khartoum where he read Islamic studies at the International University of Africa. He became fluent in Arabic and also studied the Qur'an, law (fiqh) and philosophy (falsafa), amongst others, he read the works of prominent Western thinkers and Islamic authorities and was also exposed to the four Sunni madhhabs of Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali.

                      <div class="biography-content">

                         Sarkin Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II
                           He was born on July 31, 1961 to Muhammad Aminu Sanusi and Saudatu Hussain. 
                             He descends from Royal Sullubawan Dabo of Kano and Islamic Clerical Family of Imam Gwani Muhammad Zahradeen that has produced several Imams and Islamic Judges.

                              Sanusi's father, who held the princely title of Ciroma of Kano, was a pioneer career diplomat of Nigeria. 
                              The late Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa in 1961 charged him with the setting of Nigerian Intelligence Services.
                              He served as Nigerian High Commissioner to Canada. 
                              He also served as Nigerian ambassador to Belgium. In 1972 he became Nigerian first Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China. 
                               He retired in 1979 as Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of External Affairs.

                              Sanusi was the cherished grandson of Emir Muhammad Sanusi I (r. 1954-1963), known for his strength of character and public spiritedness.
                              Credited with modernizing Kano's economy through industrial development when he established the largest industrial estate in Northern Nigeria at that time.
                              He commissioned an irrigation study that culminated in the construction of several dams across the Emirate. Muhammad Sanusi I also reinvigorated the emir's moral and spiritual role by exercising the right to lead Friday prayers and serve as Shari'ah Judge. Through adopting his grandfather's official title and other symbolic actions, Muhammad Sanusi II has explicitly signaled the continuity between his and his grandfather's reigns.
                                                                                                    
                      </div>

After childhood Qur'anic studies and elementary schooling at St. Anne's Primary Boarding School in Kaduna, Sanusi entered King's College Lagos, then earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in economics at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria -- where he also taught economics. In 1985, he launched a distinguished banking career at ICON Ltd. Merchant Bankers, a subsidiary of Morgan Guaranty Trust and Baring Brothers. Later, he joined United Bank for Africa, running its credit and risk management division and then rising to the position of General Manager. In 2005, he moved to First Bank, where he was appointed Group Managing Director in 2009.

Alongside this work in the financial industry, Sanusi never ceased pursuing his scholarship in Islamic history, philosophy, and law. After years of private study under the tutorial of a number of learned ulama' including his maternal grand uncle who was Grand Kadi (Chief Shari'ah Judge) of Kano, he left banking to enrol in the Africa International University in Khartoum, Sudan, where he earned a first class degree in Shari'ah in 1997.

In June 2009, Nigerian President Umaru Musa Yar'adua appointed Sanusi governor of the central bank. It was a trying moment to take up such a post: the world was reeling in the throes of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Nigerian banks had hardly escaped the impact: corroded by corruption, mismanagement, and reckless and fraudulent lending practices, twenty- four banks were on the brink of collapse. Sanusi pursued an approach unrivalled anywhere in the world. On the one hand, he mobilized some NGN 400b ($2.1b.) to bail out key establishments. But simultaneously, he insisted on repercussions for those responsible. Several managing directors were sacked as part of the deal, and some sixteen faced criminal charges. One received a jail term. In no other country were the individuals whose decisions contributed to the 2008 financial crisis held personally responsible on such a scale. In recognition, The Banker Magazine named Sanusi the World's Best Central Bank Governor of the Year for 2011.

Acknowledging that few names achieve consensus on any judging panel, the magazine remarked on the exception: “When it came to finding the best global central bank governor of the year, Mr. Sanusi was chosen unanimously.” The magazine lauded his “radical anti-corruption campaign,” which “salvaged a crumbling financial sector,” and “reforms that have put Africa's most promising market back on the map for investors.”

Emir Sanusi pioneered the introduction of Islamic banking into the Nigerian banking sector when he was Governor of the Central Bank, and he received the Global Islamic Finance Leadership Award (GIFA) and became the GIFA Laureate of 2015. He had earlier been given the Global Islamic Finance Excellence Award in 2013.

In late 2013, Sanusi began drawing attention to a grievous shortfall in Nigerian oil revenues. According to his accounts, some $20b, in the proceeds of sales had failed to reach the national budget over an eighteen- month period. He submitted detailed findings to the Nigerian senate on February 3, 2014, and summoned the managing directors of several banks, warning they would be required to open their books so his examiners could probe suspected shell company activities and other irregularities believed to be linked to the missing billions.

On February 20, in the midst of the investigation, President Goodluck Jonathan suspended Sanusi. In reaction, the Nigerian currency (naira) fell to its lowest level since 1999, and bond trading had to be halted.

Emir of Kano Alhaji Ado Bayero, Sanusi's granduncle, passed away on June 6, 2014, after a half-century reign. Two days later, four kingmakers and Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso announced that Lamido Sanusi was their choice to succeed him.
